# White Elephant Rules

A streamlined guide to keep the White Elephant gift exchange fun and fair. (Also known as Yankee Swap, Dirty Santa, and other names.)

## Rules

1. **Gift Contribution**:  
   Each player brings a single wrapped gift worth approximately $15 to the pool.  

2. **Drawing Numbers**:  
   Players draw numbers to determine the play order.  

3. **Setup**:  
   Players sit in a circle around the shared gift pool.  

4. **First Turn**:  
   - Player 1 selects, unwraps, and displays a gift from the pool.  

5. **Subsequent Turns**:  
   - Each player chooses to:
     - **Pick** an unwrapped gift from the pool, or  
     - **Steal** a previously opened gift.  
   - If your gift is stolen, you must:
     - Choose another unwrapped gift or steal from another player (but not the one who just stole from you).  

6. **Final Turn**:  
   - After all players have taken a turn, Player 1 gets a bonus turn:  
     - They may swap the gift they hold with any opened gift.  
     - If their gift is stolen, the same stealing rules apply.  
   - The game ends when a player declines to steal or no eligible steals remain.  

   > **Note**: The usual three-swap limit doesnâ€™t apply during the final turn, allowing unlimited swaps until a player decides to "stand pat."

## Tips

- A gift can only be stolen **once per turn**.  
- Each turn ends after **three swaps** to keep the game moving.
